Here are the aims rewritten to start with "To implement a program to...":

1. **Bisection Method**:  
   To implement a program to find the root of a given continuous function by repeatedly halving the interval and selecting the subinterval that contains the root.

2. **False Position Method**:  
   To implement a program to determine the root of a given function by iteratively narrowing down the search interval using linear interpolation. This method improves upon the bisection method by choosing the point of intersection rather than the midpoint.

3. **Newton-Raphson's Method**:  
   To implement a program to find successively better approximations to the root of a real-valued function using an iterative process. This method relies on the derivative of the function to estimate the root.

4. **Gauss Elimination Method by Pivoting**:  
   To implement a program to solve a system of linear equations by transforming the system into an upper triangular form using Gaussian elimination, with pivoting to improve numerical stability.

5. **Gauss-Jordan Method**:  
   To implement a program to solve a system of linear equations by transforming the system's augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form, which directly gives the solutions to the equations.

6. **Gauss-Seidel Method**:  
   To implement a program to iteratively solve a system of linear equations by updating the solution vector one element at a time and using the most recent values during each iteration.

7. **Forward Divided Difference Method**:  
   To implement a program to approximate the derivative of a function using forward differences. It provides an estimate of the rate of change of the function at a given point.

8. **Backward Divided Difference Method**:  
   To implement a program to approximate the derivative of a function using backward differences, which uses data points before the given point to estimate the rate of change.

9. **Central Divided Difference Method**:  
   To implement a program to approximate the derivative of a function by using data points on both sides of the given point, which can provide a more accurate estimate than forward or backward methods.

10. **CDD for Second Derivative**:  
   To implement a program to approximate the second derivative of a function using central differences, providing an estimate of how the function's rate of change itself is changing at a given point.

11. **Newton Forward Interpolation Method**:  
   To implement a program to interpolate the values of a function using equally spaced data points, providing an estimate for the function's value at points between the known data.

12. **Lagrange Interpolation Method**:  
   To implement a program to find the polynomial that passes through a given set of data points by constructing the Lagrange polynomial, which provides an interpolation function.

13. **Simpson's 1/3rd Rule**:  
   To implement a program to numerically integrate a function using the Simpson's 1/3rd rule, which approximates the integral by fitting quadratic polynomials to subintervals of the integration domain.

14. **Trapezoidal Rule for Definite Integral**:  
   To implement a program to numerically approximate the integral of a function by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids and summing their areas, providing a simpler estimate of the definite integral.

15. **Euler Method for Ordinary Differential Equations**:  
   To implement a program to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by approximating the solution using an iterative method, where each successive value is determined by stepping forward from the previous value based on the differential equation. 

Each of these aims outlines the purpose of implementing a program to solve a specific problem using a numerical method, which is central to solving various mathematical and engineering problems.
